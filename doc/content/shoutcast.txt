title: Streaming to Shoutcast

h3. Streaming to Shoutcast


Although LiquidSoap is primarily aimed at streaming to Icecast servers (that provide much more features than Shoutcast), it is also able to stream to Shoutcast, thanks to <code>libshout</code>.

h4. <code>output.shoutcast.mp3</code>

You can use the function <code>output.shoutcast.mp3</code> to feed
your server with audio data:

%%(shoutcast.liq)
source = single("audiofile.ogg")

output.shoutcast.mp3(host="shoutcast.example.org",
                     port=8000, password="changeme",
                     source)
%%

The options of <code>output.shoutcast.mp3</code> are the same as those of <code>output.icecast.mp3</code>, except for <code>mount</code> that does not exist in the Shoutcast world, and <code>protocol</code>, which is forced to ICY. This means you can set the bitrate, the samplerate, etc as you see fit. Don't forget to set your station's name / genre / description / website. Important note : you cannot set AIM / ICQ / IRC contacts, due to a limitation within libshout.

The function is defined in <code>utils.liq</code>. You need to compile LiquidSoap with <code>lame</code> support, so that it can encode to MP3.

h4. Shoutcast as relay

A side note for those of you who feel they "need" to use Shoutcast for non-technical reasons (such as their stream directory service...): you can still benefit from Icecast's power by streaming to an Icecast server, and then relaying it through a Shoutcast server.

In order to do that, you have to alias the root mountpoint ("<code>/</code>") to your MP3 mountpoint in your Icecast server configuration, like this:


<pre>
&lt;alias source="/" dest="/mystream.mp3" /&gt;
</pre>


Be careful that Icecast often aliases the status page (<code>/status.xsl</code>) with the <code>/</code>. In this case, comment out the status page alias before inserting yours.
