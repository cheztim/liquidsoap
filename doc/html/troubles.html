   <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

   <p>
     If you don't find your answer here, which is likely,
     please email us at
     <a href="mailto:savonet-users@lists.sourceforge.net">savonet-users</a>.
     We are waiting for your questions, and will update this file
     quickly.
   </p>

   <h3>Parse error</h3>

   <p>
    The parser is not very smart and currently requires you to
    put many many parenthesis, around products and list elements.
    When it is lost, the error message is not very informative.
    Think about adding extra parenthesis, maybe you forgot some.
   </p>

   <p>
    For example, we need you to write
    <code>[ (op "foo") ; (op "bar") ]</code> <b>with</b> the parenthesis.
    It is planned to work on that annoying stupidity.
   </p>

   <h3>Scheduler died !</h3>

   <p>
    Check the liveness of your scheduler. Maybe it just lacks a
    source that can always deliver frames. <code>local_playlist</code>,
    or <code>one_file</code> with a local file are perfect for that.
    Common error: maybe you want to play a local playlist but you use it
    via a <code>playlist</code> source ? Try <code>local_playlist</code> !
   </p>

   <p>
    Unfortunately, this is also the most common serious bug in liquidsoap.
    So if you still don't understand why it happens, please contact me.
   </p>

   <h3>Strange source name</h3>

   <p>
    You may see in requests metadatas a field <code>source</code> set to
    something like <code>(nobody.110)</code>.
    It should only happen if the request was created at the creation of
    the source, before that the parser gives a name to the source.
    I think it only happens for the infallible <code>one_file</code>,
    which happens when the URI is static.
    If you discover any other case, please tell me.
   </p>

   <h3>My scheduling intervals are misinterpreted</h3>

   <p>
   When you write <code>0-1h</code> it means
   "from midnight until 2:00". It should be
   read as "as long as the hour digit is between 0 and 1".
