.SH DESCRIPTION
.B liquidsoap
is an extensible and flexible audio stream generator, mainly used for 
streaming to a shoutcast/icecast server. It is also possible to output in a 
file, or as a CD quality WAV RTP stream,
which can then be remotely encoded and relayed using another instance of
.BR liquidsoap.
.BR liquidsoap
can perform any audio processing, mixing streams together, applying filters, 
generating sound procedurally, there is no limit but your imagination.
Input files can be accessed through the network, using samba, ftp or speech 
synthesis.
Recognized formats are mp3, vorbis, and wav.
Liquidsoap also inputs RTP and HTTP streams.
The system features lots of programming operators, including user requests,
time-based selection, sum.
Many of these features are optional, so it is possible that they are 
not enabled in your installation.

.I script.liq
is a
.B liquidsoap
script containing the settings and the source definitions.
The script will be read from standard input if
.B \-\-
is given as script filename.
