=====Installation=====

Several ways of installing liquidsoap are possible. In most cases you can choose which features you want. Here are liquidsoap's dependencies (all OCaml libraries are distributed by Savonet, except Camomile):
~- [[http://www.ocaml-programming.de/programming/findlib.html ocamlfind]]
~- ocaml-dtools
~- ocaml-vorbis
~- ocaml-shout
And also optional dependencies:
~- ocaml-mad for mp3 decoding
~- [[http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/ libid3tag]] for reading mp3's id3 metadata
~- ocaml-mp3id3 for reading mp3's id3 metadata
~- [[http://camomile.sourceforge.net/ camomile]] for detecting metadata encodings and re-encoding them to utf8
~- ocaml-lame for mp3 encoding
~- ocaml-alsa for alsa input/output
~- [[http://www.linphone.org/ libortp]] for RTP input/output
~- [[http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/ wget]] for downloading remote files (http, https, ftp)
~- ufetch (provided by ocaml-fetch) for downloading remote files (smb, http, ftp)
~- [[http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/ festival]] for speech synthesis (say)

====Install from source tarballs====
The primary mean of stable distribution is source tarballs. They are available on the [[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=89802 download section]] of the project's page on sourceforge. They all follow the GNU conventions, and are built and installed using the common ##./configure##, ##make## and ##make install##.

====Subversion repository (and other distributions)====
If you want a cutting-edge version, you can use the subversion repository. To get a copy of it, just run:
%%(bash)
svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/savonet/trunk savonet
%%
From every sub-project's directory you can build and install the package using ##./bootstrap##, ##./configure##, ##make## and optionally ##make install##.
From the toplevel ##savonet## directory you can also directly build a vanilla liquidsoap. It's fast and doesn't require you to install the libraries. The steps to follow are simple:
%%(bash)
# Edit PACKAGES to choose which feature you want
./bootstrap
./configure
make
# To install liquidsoap, you'll usually need to type the following as root
make install
%%

====Debian====
Debian packages are available for some libraries on the [[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=89802 download section]] of the project's page on sourceforge. A ##.deb## package, for example ##toto.deb##, can be installed using ##dpkg -i toto.deb##.
The main libraries already entered the official Debian distribution, and we're currently working on packaging liquidsoap too.

====Gentoo====
The ebuilds available on our SVN are very outdated, but there is ongoing work on updating and including them directly in the official distribution.

====OSX====
There have been successful installations on OSX (both Intel and PPC), using Fink and the Godi distribution of OCaml. Claudio reports his two successes on [[http://savonet.sf.net/wiki/InstallationOSX the OSX page]].
