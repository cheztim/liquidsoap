 How to install
 --------------

 % ./configure

 For the speech synthesis, a "liquidtts" script will be installed.
 It makes use of text2wave (from festival) if found. Otherwise, it uses
 false as a synthetizer, and you can edit it.
 sox and normalize are also used in liquitts if installed.

 % make

 Then, you may proceed to the installation. You may need to be root for that.
 Also, user and group liquidsoap should be created prior to installation.
 If you want to use other user/groups, please edit Makefile.defs.

 % make install (as root if needed)

 Installation does not include installation of doc, which is put
 into $datadir/doc/$DISTDIR using:

 % make install-doc

 For installing developers documention, run:

 % make api-install-doc

 Then if you want services to be installed in $prefix/etc/init.d, run one of
 the following. service is for a generic /bin/sh service, gentoo is for
 a gentoo compliant service, to be used iff you've a gentoo linux.

 % make (service|gentoo)-install

 See /doc for understanding radio programming. I hope you'll have fun.
