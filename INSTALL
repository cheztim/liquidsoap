 How to install
 --------------

 *BSD users, as well as OSX users might need to export some variables 
 that can be missing during the process:
   % export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include
   % export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib
   % export OCAMLMKLIB_FLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib 
 Also, liquidsoap needs GNU make. If you have a GNU make, this is normally
 Detected during configuration. If this chec fails you can set the MAKE variable:
   % export MAKE=`your make command`
 The following assumes your MAKE command is make. Change to yours if different..

 Now you can start the build configuration:
   % ./configure

 And then build the software:
   % make

 This builds liquidsoap.

   % make doc

 It will generate the HTML documentation, including a version of the scripting
 API reference corresponding to your configuration. If Perl's module XML::DOM
 is not available it only generate a stub reference and issue a warning.

 Then, you may proceed to the installation. You may need to be root for that.
 Also, user and group liquidsoap should be created prior to installation.
 If you want to use other user/groups, please edit Makefile.defs -- unless
 you prefer to re-run the configure script with the proper --with-user/group.

   % make install (as root if needed)

 For installing developers documentation, run:

   % make api-doc-install

 Then if you want services to be installed in $prefix/etc/init.d, run one of
 the following. service is for a generic /bin/sh service, gentoo is for
 a gentoo compliant service, to be used iff you've a gentoo linux.

   % make (service|gentoo)-install

 See /doc for understanding radio programming. I hope you'll have fun.
