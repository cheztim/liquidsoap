 How to install
 --------------

 % ./configure

 % make

 This builds liquidsoap.

 % make doc
 or
 % make fakedoc

 It will generate a reference file lang.html and the manual.pdf,
 also including a reference. This requires Perl and its
 XML::DOM module and also a working pdflatex installation, including 
 the a4wide.sty model, included in tetex-extra package on debian. 
 If you don't want to bother about the doc, you can skip it
 using "make fakedoc".

 Then, you may proceed to the installation. You may need to be root for that.
 Also, user and group liquidsoap should be created prior to installation.
 If you want to use other user/groups, please edit Makefile.defs.

 % make install (as root if needed)

 For installing developers documentation, run:

 % make api-install-doc

 Then if you want services to be installed in $prefix/etc/init.d, run one of
 the following. service is for a generic /bin/sh service, gentoo is for
 a gentoo compliant service, to be used iff you've a gentoo linux.

 % make (service|gentoo)-install

 See /doc for understanding radio programming. I hope you'll have fun.
