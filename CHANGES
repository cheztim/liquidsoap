0.3.1 (17-11-2006)
* More standards-compliant tarball
* Generate doc with locally built liquidsoap
* Try to cope with ill-formed mp3
* Updated for newer versions of Camomile
* So-called "strict" random-mode

0.3.0 (27-08-2006)
* Many minor and major fixes at every level!
* Conversion of metadata to UTF8.
* Got rid of too many threads by scheduling all download tasks
  in a single thread, and handling all of the server's clients
  in another single thread.
* Simplified the time interval syntax and integrated it to the script language.
* New protocol: Wget for FTP, HTTP and HTTPS.
* Ability to define a new protocol from the script,
  typically using an external app/script for resolution, such as bubble.
* Ability to use an external app/script for dynamically creating requests.
* New on_metadata operator for performing arbitrary actions (typically
  a call to an external script) when metadata packets occur in a stream.
* MP3 encoding, to file or shout.
* API renamings and simplification.
* Supports transition, as functions of type (source,source) -> source
  in all switching operators: schedule, random, fallback.
* Restart icecast2 outputs on failures.
* Major changes to the scripting language which is more uniform and flexible,
  has functions, a helpful (?) type inference, and a simple Ruby-like syntax.
* Timing constraints and synchronization are managed by Root
  in a centralized way, no more by the many outputs which need it.
* Audio decoding is no more based on file extensions,
  but on the existence of a valid decoder.
* Added the equeue operators which allows interactive building of playlists,
  supporting insertion and moving of queued requests -- queue only allows
  you to push requests and cancel queued requests.
* A Python-Gtk GUI for controlling operators, or more specifically as a console
  for creating your live show -- to be updated, still unstable.
* Alsa input and output.
* Blank detection, automatically skips on too long blanks, or strip them.
* Http ogg/vorbis relay, the way to relay live shows.
* Interactive mixer.
* The request system was mostly rewritten to really fulfill its specification.
* The server is no more associated to the queue operator but is now something
  external, in which all operators can plug commands. This much more logical
  design lead to many more interactive controls. The syntax of command outputs
  was also simplified for easier automated processing.
* Dynamic loading of plugins.
* Outputs are now operators. It makes it possible to output different streams
  in a single instance of Liquidsoap, which RadioPi needed. As a consequence
  we removed the restriction that one source must have at most one father,
  without any extra burden for the user.

0.2.0 (20-04-2005)
* Proper initial release.

0.1.0 (2004)
* Release for academic demonstration, not functionnal.
