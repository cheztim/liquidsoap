  Core features:
  ==============

  * Add include possiblity and some basic libraries for liquidsoap scripts
  * Fix resampling, possibly with an external library
  * Transitions with non-zero "before" parameter don't work correctly,
    as the before-trigger also occurs during the transition itself, resulting
    in an ugly scattered sound effect.
  * Move the metadatas (and skip, remaining ?) commands out of the outputs and 
    put it in a dedicated operator which could be put anywhere in the stream, 
    typically before metadata rewriting.
  * There has been some reports of non-immediate coming back of the lives after 
    stripped blanks.
  * Memoization for encodings of buffers. Keep them in the buffer.
    Useful when saving a copy of icecast stream to a file.
    The problem is that buffers are copied for outputs and multiple-fathered
    sources, dealing with this may be tricky.
  * Check WAV handling, add support for incorrect WAV format.
  * Dynamic download time evaluation for queues.
    Deal with big files download, which currently leads to timeout.
  * Code like (1^"ba") in scripts causes silly error messages:
    This value has type (string, string) -> string
    but is expected to have type (int, string) -> '3!
    The real mistake is that the int is expected to be a string.
  * Decrease the cost of Vorbis.reset_metadata, which systematically
    causes a latency on new tracks.
  * Fix RTP output.
  * Fix alsa output.
  * Add jack support and, perhaps fix the two above using jack !

  Plugins:
  ========

  * Ogg/vorbis rtp output
  * Add transitions to the add operator.
  * Mini icecast server, in order to have more reactive systems for live
    shows. Directly send the stream to liquidsoap.
  * Binary clock.
  * A fair scheduler for user requests.
  * Long requests: as long as there is no request, and not much than an hour
    long for example, play an user-requested playlist.
    Actually this could come from a more general Request structure involving 
    any nesting of alternatives and conjunctions, instead of only disjunctions 
    as it is now.
